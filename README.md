# RollORHold
A 2-player game based on DOM-manipulation in the browser
Rules of the game are:<br>
->Player 1 goes first. "ROLL" the die for your first turn.<br>
->Score will be counted on the current score if the number rolled is two, three, four, five, or six points. If you roll a one, you lose all the points you accumulated during that turn, and you lose your turn.<br>
->Continue rolling the die until you're happy with the number of points you've scored. Then, "HOLD" by handing the die over to your opponent, and track all points earned during your turn.<br>
->Second player continues the same. Reach 100 points first and win the game.<br>
<strong>"KNOWING WHEN TO STOP ROLLING AND END YOUR TURN IS THE KEY TO WINNING, IT'S AN EXERCISE IN DECIDING BETWEEN GUT, INSTINCT AND GREED"</strong>
